# image-resizer

This program is a Python script that uses the Tkinter module to create a graphical user interface (GUI) for resizing an image inputted by the user. The program supports resizing images to a custom size specified by the user.

Installation
Make sure you have Python 3.x installed on your machine.
Clone or download the source code from the GitHub repository.
Usage
To run the program, navigate to the directory where the script is located and run the following command:

sh
Copy code
python image_resizer.py
The GUI will appear with a "Choose File" button. Click on the button to select the image file you want to resize. Once you have selected the file, you can specify the desired dimensions of the resized image by entering the width and height values in pixels.

Click the "Resize" button to resize the image to the specified dimensions. The resized image will be saved in the same directory as the original image file with "_resized" appended to the filename.
